Dynamic models using ordinary differential equations to see the co-administration effects of anti-VEGF and chemotherapeutic drugs on breast tumor growth.

In cancer therapy, the combination of anti-VEGF drugs with cytotoxic chemotherapy has been a subject of significant research interest. Anti-VEGF drugs, such as bevacizumab, have been shown to improve the delivery of cytotoxic agents to tumors, enhancing the effectiveness of combination therapy (Tong et al., 2004). This combination has been particularly explored in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), where standard regimens often include doublet cytotoxic chemotherapy with anti-VEGF monoclonal antibodies like bevacizumab (Ciombor & Bekaii‚ÄêSaab, 2013). Studies have indicated that the use of anti-VEGF drugs can lead to vascular normalization, which improves drug penetration in tumors and enhances the efficacy of chemotherapy (Casanovas, 2012).  However, the timing and scheduling of anti-VEGF therapy in combination with cytotoxic drugs are crucial. Research has shown that there can be a rapid decrease in the delivery of chemotherapy to tumors after anti-VEGF therapy, emphasizing the importance of optimizing drug scheduling in combination therapy (Lai & Friedman, 2019). Additionally, the synergistic effects of anti-VEGF targeted therapy and chemotherapy have been confirmed, highlighting the potential benefits of combining these treatment modalities (Liu et al., 2021).  Furthermore, the concept of vascular normalization induced by anti-angiogenic therapy has been proposed as a mechanism to enhance the efficacy of cytotoxic drugs. This theory suggests that anti-angiogenic therapy can normalize tumor vasculature, leading to improved drug penetration and increased perfusion, ultimately enhancing the effectiveness of cytotoxic agents (Casanovas, 2012).
